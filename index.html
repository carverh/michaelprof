			<h1>Michael's stuff</h1>
			<p>Below is a categorized list of everything I've made as either a personal project, a YouTube tutorial or as a school project in my Communication Technology course.</p>
			<p>Note: Image previews are not yet implemented because I haven't learned enough CSS to do that in a way it'll look nice. So, there's just file listings for now.</p>
			<div id="list_container">
